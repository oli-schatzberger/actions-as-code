== First steps:
I started watching a few youtube videos to get the basics of gh-actions.
Especially https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8_veQiYBjI[this] video helped me a lot because I have been able to work along while learning.

== Create workflow
Create a new github-repo and clone it start with creating these folders.
[source, shell]
----
mkdir .github/workflows
----

Create the workflow file it doesn't matter how you name it.
[source, shell]
----
touch first_workflow.yml
----

=== Explanation of the workflow.yml file

on:

is like an event so gh-action runs this workflow if something new is pushed to main and if there are new files in docs/* .

jobs:

are the task that have to be executed in a workflow

=== Convert adoc to html
For this step I used a gh-actions plugin from *Quirin Ecker* who also visited our school. It was very easy
to use, and I had no problems.

*runs-on:*

defines the runner for your job

*env:*

section where you define your enviroment variables
but be careful they are visible for everyone. sensitive data should be saved in the repo secrets.

*uses:*

reference the used plugins here

=== update the data on the Oracle Cloud

This job gains access over the Oracle VM via SSH and the private key.
The private key is defined as a repo Secret in the repo-settings.

*needs:*

waits until the definded job is done after that the current one starts


*script:*

write all the statements here that you want to execute on the VM

=== define secrets on GitHub

First go to your repo.

that's how you use the secrets

== Setup Oracle VM
* Setup up a Ubuntu VM
* add a new user
* give the user sudo-rights
* install nginx
* change iptables
* add ingress rule
